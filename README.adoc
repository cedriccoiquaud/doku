== Co-op Money Infrastructure

[.lead]
The New Money Infrastructure project aims to develop a global and decentralized crypto-currency infrastructure for payments and other financial services as well as financial instruments. The planned infrastructure will significantly differ from the current infrastructure of the financial sector as well as from the current cryptocurrencies and will have the following main-features:

* It is developed for classical currencies and converts, for example, euros into crypto central bank euros (positive money, Vollgeld).
* It consists of standards and open source programs that run on users' existing hardware (mobiles, computers etc.) with internet access.
* It transmits payments directly between users and prevents them from manipulating their own or othersâ€™ data.
* It is an instrument for people and the real economy that works independently of the existing financial sector.
* It promotes fair trade and sustainable business practices in a very efficient way.
