== What is the _Co-op Money Infrastructure_?

[.lead]
The _**Co-op Money Infrastructure**_ project aims to develop a global and decentralized infrastructure for payments and other financial services as well as financial instruments. The system is generalized so that any right or obligation can be documented, proven or transferred. As a result, it could also be used as a general trading platform.

The planned infrastructure will be significantly different from the current infrastructure of the financial sector as well as the current crypto currencies and will be characterized by the following main features:

* It is developed for classical currencies and converts, for example, euros into crypto central bank euros (digital cash, positive money, secure money, Vollgeld).
* It consists of standards and open source programs that run on users' existing hardware (mobiles, computers etc.) with internet access.
* It transfers payments or any other rights directly between users and prevents them from manipulating their own or others’ data.
* It is an instrument for people and the real economy that works independently of the existing financial sector.
* It promotes fair trade and sustainable business practices in a very efficient way.

For the user the _Co-op Money Infrastructure_ will appear like a mix of online banking and PayPal with the difference that the users will create and manage their accounts themselves. Users will also find that the complexity of banking and financial instruments is significantly reduced and additional features are available.

Through an interface, payments between the _Co-op Money Infrastructure_ and commercial banks can be made in the usual way. For a _Co-op Money Infrastructure_ account, a regular international bank account number (IBAN) can be requested and in that case the account will appear like a regular current account; but would be comparable in terms of quality with an account at the central bank or cash.

The interface is also a firewall that protects the real economy from turbulences in the financial sector.

Due to the design, only a fraction of the previous costs for financial services are incurred and the gross profit on financial products can be shared by the users. The money infrastructure contributes to the decentralization of the power concentrated in the financial sector, which is returned to the users.

An overview of important characteristics between cash, deposit money, Bitcoin and the co-op money infrastructure is shown in the following table:

[[key-ideas]]
== Key ideas

Although some key ideas have been adopted from crypto currencies, there are significant differences and new ideas.

=== Self-administered crypto accounts
Banknotes securitize money, current accounts book the money, and the _Co-op Money Infrastructure_ proves and provides ownership of central bank money on cryptographically protected accounts that are self-administered by the users.

The infrastructure is not meant to create new money, but provides _digital bearer instruments_ for existing money. That's a kind of digital cash.

The money infrastructure is for any currency. In order to handle several currencies in parallel, the account management is simplified by additionally displaying amounts on an accounts in a currency of your choice. Transfers between accounts of different currencies are automatically converted into the target currency.

The creation of money and monetary policy is seen as the task of the central banks and the profit through money creation should benefit the community.

To stabilize the financial markets and thus the economy as a whole, a global currency or clearing unit of account could be established within the money infrastructure.

=== Ultimate decentralization
The _Co-op Money Infrastructure_ is decentralized in four ways:

. No central administrative authority.
. Each user stores only his own data and optionally encrypted backups of other users.
. Shared data is stored on distributed server clusters running on users' hardware.
. Transactions and contracts are only exchanged between the parties directly involved.

As a result, data volume and traffic are cut down to a minimum while maximizing efficiency, effectiveness and privacy. For most, and especially private users, the money infrastructure programs run on their existing hardware and thus cause no additional expenditure.

The current crypto currencies are decentralized in the first sense that there is no _central_ _authority_ that manages the system but there is a common ledger, the blockchain, whose data is stored by all full nodesfootnote:[The clients in the Bitcoin network are called nodes. A full node is a client who stores the complete block chain. More: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Full_node[https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Full_node]].

Early in 2018, the blockchain was about 160 GB in size and there were about 15 million users, but less than 10,000 full nodes that all the other users need to trust in. One of the key objectives of a decentralized system in which no trustees are required is not realized in practice by Bitcoin. - For this, each of the 15 million users would need to store the blockchain, resulting in a data volume of 2,400,000,000 GB, plus an even higher traffic.

In the Co-op Money Infrastructure, the 160 GB would be distributed amongst the 15 million users according to their individual use and without the need of trustees. This result is achieved through a newly developed _legal consensus mechanism_.

=== Legal consensus mechanism
For all crypto currencies, consensus mechanismsfootnote:[A good overview of the consensus mechanisms can be found in _Consensus – Immutable agreement for the Internet of value_: https://assets.kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmg/pdf/2016/06/kpmg-blockchain-consensus-mechanism.pdf[https://assets.kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmg/pdf/2016/06/kpmg-blockchain-consensus-mechanism.pdf]] are central to the functioning of any blockchain or distributed ledger. This ensures the correctness of payments and prevents manipulation without the need to trust or rely on a central authority. So far, this problem has been solved purely technically.

Through the newly developed _legal consensus mechanism_ not only money, but all rights and obligations might be turned into digital bearer instruments that have been signed by the senders and can only be read and processed by the legitimate recipients.

The signed data, together with the rights and obligations arising from a contract, will be complementarily distributed amongst the contracting parties, with the result that a party who manipulates his data would destroy his own rights and yet would have to fulfil his obligations under the contract. Rights and data are inextricably linked, as are rights and paper in securities. The rights from the data follow the rights to the data. The power of control over the data is ensured by cryptographic methods and possession.

.Legal Consesus Mechanism
[#img-Legal_Consesus_Mechanism]
image::MI015.png[Legal Consesus Mechanism]

The correct content of the data is also legally secured through the complementary interests of the parties: The right of the creditor to claim a particular performance refers to the identical performance that the debtor has to provide.

For example, a contract signed by the seller certifies the rights of the buyer and the obligations of the seller. This unique data is stored in the buyer's blockchain. As a result, only he can actually and legally dispose of these data. The buyer cannot manipulate these data because the seller signed them. And without these data, the buyer cannot assert his rights against the seller and the seller is under no obligation to perform.

And vice versa, the contract signed by the buyer certifies the rights of the seller and the obligations of the buyer. This unique data is stored in the seller's blockchain and only he can actually and legally dispose of these data.

The legal consensus mechanism causes users to not manipulate their data; otherwise their own rights would be destroyed. Therefore, the data must be protected only from accidental and third party manipulations, hardware failures and software errors. To prevent such incidents, there are several redundant protection mechanisms installed that can be supplemented by the user himself, if he wishes to do so.

"Proof of Work" is currently the consensus mechanism in the most popular crypto currencies, such as Bitcoin. At the beginning of March 2018, Bitcoin's estimated power consumption was 54 TWh per year and will reach 125 TWh per year by the end of 2018. Thus, this power consumption is higher than that of 10 million respectively 25 million four-person households in Germany.

In the money infrastructure, this tremendous energy consumption is not required and is replaced by a single paragraph within the terms of use, thereby doing more than the "Proof of Work" mechanism: the scaling of the system is independent of the number of users and the transactions can be executed in real time.

=== Blockchain trees

The legal consensus mechanism leads to the fact that a user does not want to manipulate his data. Any manipulation would destroy the own rights and the obligations of the counterparty.

To efficiently determine the integrity of the payload data, they are embedded in a metadata structure that gives these data additional properties that are essential to the money infrastructure. The data must be authentic, complete and time-related.

The authenticity is necessary so that data can be unambiguously assigned to the creator. The system must ensure that rights, obligations and legal dispositions can be indisputably and legally attributed to the legal entity concerned.

The completeness of the data refers to a specific retention period, which varys due to legal regulations and user needs. In the planned system, for example, completeness should be ensured for accounting, but outside of the specified periods of time the data could be deleted by system-internal functions  without this being interpreted as an illegal manipulation of the data.

Not storing all the data for all time is a requirement of sustainability, efficiency and costs.

The time reference is made by a timestamp. It is a requirement for the retention period and in applications such as e.g. the ledger in an accounting system.

The means by which to obtain these additional properties for the data is the blockchain.

==== Blockchain

The term blockchain is used in two very different ways.

In the proper sense, a blockchain is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are chained together and secured using cryptography. Each block typically contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp and payload data. By design, a blockchain is inherently resistant to modification of the data whose integrity can be checked very efficiently. These features are the reason to use blockchain technology.

The application of this technology to certain cryptocurrencies led to the second meaning: A blockchain is a decentralized, public digital ledger of transactions that can not be manipulated due to cryptographic methods.

Here I use the term blockchain in the first sense and call the second meaning a _blockchain application_. The term _blockchain tree_ used in the following is also a blockchain application, which however differs substantially from the previous use in cryptocurrencies.

A blockchain tree consists of independent blockchains linked by a rooted tree structure. The root and leave nodes of the tree contain blockchains. The first block in a leave blockchain contains as the first entry the hash of the first block of the root blockchain and the path.

==== Identity blockchain tree

Identity services are a most important feature of the money infrastructure. They are the bridge between the computer-generated virtual world and real people. Technically, an identity is an object in the sense of object-oriented programming. That means an identity has attributes and a behavior that is determined by the represented real person.

Storing and managing identities is the job of the distributed identity server cluster. The data of the identities are stored in a graph database management system that implements a blockchain tree. The Identity Server Cluster is a common component of the money infrastructure and runs on particularly suitable user hardware. The motivation for users to provide resources for an Identity Server is the ability to earn money and to process their own transactions faster.

Since the rights, duties and legal dispositions of a natural or legal person are documented and inextricable linked to data in the money infrastructure, a one-to-one connection to the person concerned is indispensable. A person is represented in the system by a virtual identity and can act through that identity in the system. All rights, duties and legal acts that are assigned to an identity are directly attributed to the corresponding person.

In the legal sense, there are two types of persons. Natural persons refer to humans. Legal persons refer to all other legal subjects, e.g. companies or institutions.

A _legal_ person acts through the identity of another identity that occupies one or more roles within that legal entity. In this way, as in reality, chains of representations can emerge, at the ends of which a natural person stands.

A role gives an identity certain rights, obligations and powers of the represented legal subject.

Informational self-determination is a basic principle of the money infrastructure. Therefore, a person decides which data they want to make accessible to whom. In turn, this decision determines a person's rights and possibilities in the system.

For example, a person in a developed country could only conclude a loan agreement within the money infrastructure if it has an officially confirmed identity whose data is made available to the contracting party. This restriction complies with legal requirements and prevents a person from evading their duties.

However, in regions where government structures are poorly developed, it should be possible to obtain loans based on identities verified by counterparties or by personal inspection.

For both cases, mechanisms are available that promote and, if necessary, enforce sanctity of contracts. One mechanism is called the _compliance index_ and the other is implemented through so-called recommended, standardized and balanced contracts.

The profile of an identity and the changes are stored in its own blockchain. The first block contains all the necessary data to identify a person and a video in which the person expressly commits to comply with the rules of the money infrastructure. This declaration of commitment is a specific sentence that must be repeated.

The profile of an identity and the changes are stored in its own blockchain.

.Blockchain tree for identities
[#img-Blockchain_tree_for_identities]
image::MI022.png[Blockchain tree for identities]

The first block contains encrypted all necessary data for the identification of a person and a video in which the person expressly commits himself to comply with the rules of the money infrastructure. This commitment is a specific sentence.

The individual data and the video are used to calculate hash values, which are summarized in a Merkle tree.

The second block contains public or business partner released profile data and published certificates. The Merkle tree over the profile data is used to check whether the published profile data matches the encrypted profile data.

The other blocks contain additions and changes to the profile data.

==== User data blockchain tree

=== Recommended, standardized and balanced contracts (RSB contracts)

*Fair trade* *and sustainable business practices* are an extra asset, implemented as an efficient and profitable business model.

Within the _Co-op Money Infrastructure_, business is done with recommended, standardized and balanced contracts (RSB contracts). Contractors should be able to focus on their performance and not have to worry about being tricked by legal intricacies.

RSB contract templates capture and extend the idea of "Smart Contracts". Simply explained an RSB contract is an instrument that allows users to easily and efficiently conduct their business without having to understand the legal details. Users can trust that the different interests are balanced. They are abstract legal structures that, like numbers in mathematics, are described differently in different languages, but have the same meaning in all languages. For RSB contracts there is a localized certified copy in all required languages. The claims and also possible legal consequences in the event of disruptions to performance are clearly indicated in a transparent manner.

What applies to trade in general will apply even more to financial services and financial instruments, which will serve exclusively the people and the real economy.

RSB contracts are well thought out and well coordinated. They implement the idea of international standards in the field of contract law. The motto is as few templates as possible and as many as necessary.

RSB contracts are objects in the sense of object-oriented programming. They have a status, respond to events and can communicate with or act legally for the parties. For example, payments are not made to the payee but to the contracts, which then forward the payments to the payee upon confirmation of reception of the goods by the payee.

RSB contracts generate all the accounting records in various accounting standards that belong to a contract and its related transactions.

RSB contract templates are developed by users, validated by stakeholders and adopted by majority vote.

The RSB contracts go far beyond the points raised, and exploiting their potential will not only be the task of a follow-up project, but will provide business opportunities in many areas.

This includes:

. Automatic accounting not only for companies but for the public sector as well
. Business and economic evaluations to an unprecedented extent and quality
. Risk management and services
. Default management and services
. Collateral management and services
. Rating services

== What is the 'status quo' of todays' financial world and the crypto currencies?

Today there is an over-supply of financial services and financial instruments worldwide. A lot of them are incomprehensible and certainly not transparent, even for experts. As far back as 2006, global money and financial instruments’ supply had six times more volume than the gross domestic product of the entire world.

However, the financial sector has left its service role in many areas for the real economy, with the sole aim of making more money out of money.

With the income and profits generated, goods and services of the real economy are bought without the financial sector itself making a substantial contribution.

These ‘none performance-related incomes’ are considered completely normal and perfectly alright by the recipients. It is ignored that in the macroeconomic context, these incomes predominantly go to the disadvantage of the middle and lower classes.

And also the current crypto-currencies, such as Bitcoin do not represent a real alternative, because by decoupling money production from any institutional or governmental control, the failures in the financial sector will only be driven to new and so far unknown levels.

== Why do we want to offer something different?

Because we want:

* To provide financial services for everybody in the worldfootnote:[World Bank documentation shows that 2 billion people in the world do not have any access to bank services, mainly in the developing countries, which does not make their situation any better.], simple, easy and fair.
* To give central banks a new possibility of their monetary policy independent of the financial sector.
* To better protect people and the real economy from the negative impact of the financial sector and from financial crises.
* To make banking services much more efficient and user-friendly through innovative ideas.
* To make the entire exchange of goods and services more fair and transparent, not just financial services and instruments.
* To stop banks of buying goods and services from the real economy with self-made money.
* To increase the profit for the community from the central bank money creation.
* To leave the field not to the existing crypto-money scene for an uncontrolled private money creation.

== How do we want to make a difference?

Within the _Co-op Money Infrastructure_, the money becomes central bank money (positive money, Vollgeld). It is thus in contrast to money in a current account at a commercial bank and in contrast to bitcoins, which are still completely unregulated private money and serve a predominantly speculative purpose.

It would be comparable to cash and thus even safer in the case of financial crises than commercial bank money. Compared to cash, it would be better protected against counterfeiting and theft by using cryptographic methods.

Figure 3 shows the key features of cash, deposit money, Bitcoin, and money in the _Co-op Money Infrastructure._

.Key features of cash, deposit money, Bitcoin, and money in the Co-op Money Infrastructure
[#img-key_features_of_cash_depositmoney_bitcoin_mi]
image::MI006.png[Key features of different kinds of money]

The implementation of the _Co-op Money Infrastructure_ will be implemented in the ‘style’ of Wikipedia: From bottom to top and supported by many for all.

"As simple as possible, but not simpler" is the guiding principle of the _Co-op Money Infrastructure_ for the design of financial services and financial products and the execution of contracts.

The introduction and operation of the _Co-op Money Infrastructure_ deliberately does not rely on the idealism of supporters and users but on solid economic benefits for those involved. The benefits include significantly lower costs for financial services and the ability for financial products to be negotiated and shared directly between users. There are also savings in trading and accounting.

== Project description
=== Content of the project

The _Co-op Money Infrastructure_ consists of two functional subsystems:

. A rights and obligations management system to create and fulfil contracts.
. A rights and obligations documentation system to document, prove and evaluate contracts and transactions.

In the context discussed here only those rights and obligations are considered which can be assigned a value and thus can be bought or sold at a price. The rights and obligations include the assets and liabilities of a balance sheet.

Credit money is considered as a legal relationship between a creditor and a debtor. The one end is a claim and thus a right and the other end a liability and thus an obligation.

The situation is quite different with bitcoins, which are special property rights on data in the blockchain.

The considerable simplifications result from this abstraction and generalization. This makes it possible that not only money but all rights and obligations can be mapped, managed and processed internally in the same way.

The planned project will be an open source project being managed in GitHub: https://github.com/money-infrastructure

=== Interface with the banking sector

A system-compliant integration could be carried out analogously to the position "Banknotes in circulation" via a new balance sheet item: ‘Crypto-Money in circulation’.

The underlying accounts would be used to settle payments between the _Co-op Money Infrastructure_ and commercial banks.

The cooperation with a central bank is not mandatory. If no central bank agrees to cooperate, the interface to the central bank could also be established through an ethical bank.

This bank would manage the cash reserves of the money infrastructure, legally owned by the respective crypto-money holders.
