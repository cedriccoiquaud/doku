[.lead]
The *New Money Infrastructure project* aims to develop a global and decentralized crypto-currency infrastructure for payments and other financial services as well as financial instruments. The planned infrastructure will significantly differ from the current infrastructure of the financial sector as well as from the current cryptocurrencies and will have the following main-features:

* It is developed for classical currencies and converts, for example, euros into crypto central bank euros (positive money, Vollgeld).
* It consists of standards and open source programs that run on users' existing hardware (mobiles, computers etc.) with internet access.
* It transmits payments directly between users and prevents them from manipulating their own or others’ data.
* It will be an "economic and creative commons" for people and the real economy with equal rights and obligations that works independently of the existing financial sector.
* It promotes fair trade and sustainable business practices in a very efficient way.

===== Requirements



===== Functional Subsystems of the New Money Infrastructure

The _New Money Infrastructure_ consists of two functional subsystems:

. A rights and obligations management system to create and fulfil contracts.
. A rights and obligations documentation system to document and evaluate contracts and transactions.

In the context discussed here only those rights and obligations are considered which can be assigned a value and thus can be bought or sold at a price. The rights and obligations include the assets and liabilities of a balance sheet.

Credit money is considered as a legal relationship between a creditor and a debtor. The one end is a claim and thus a right and the other end a liability and thus an obligation.

The situation is quite different with bitcoins, which are special property rights on data in the blockchain.

The considerable simplifications result from this abstraction and generalization. This makes it possible that not only money but all rights and obligations can be mapped, managed and processed internally in the same way.

The planned project will be an open source project being managed in GitHub: https://github.com/money-infrastructure

[#img-functional_subsystems_nmi]

===== Overview of the main ideas

Although some key ideas have been adopted from crypto currencies, there are significant differences and new ideas.

* *Self-administered crypto accounts* to create digital bearer instruments for normal currencies and other rights or obligations.
* *Ultimate decentralization* for maximum efficiency, effectiveness and privacy.
* *Legal consensus mechanism* for immutable agreements for the Internet of value. Unlike the tremendous energy consumption that Bitcoin requires, this mechanism does not consume energy.
* *Recommended, standardized and balanced contracts (RSB contracts)* for easy handling of financial services and instruments as well as exchange of goods and services in general.

The New Money Infrastructure consists of two logical layers.

. A thin server layer that stores control, meta, and shared data. This layer consists of one or more distributed multi-master server clusters with decentralized governance.

. A client app layer that stores all user data. Each user stores only his own data in a self-administered blockchain tree. A user can optionally stores encrypted backups of other users.

===== Self-administered crypto accounts
Banknotes securitize money, current accounts book the money, and the _New Money Infrastructure_ proves and provides ownership of central bank money on cryptographically protected accounts that are self-administered by the users. The infrastructure is not meant to create new money, but is a _digital bearer instrument_ for existing money.

The creation of money and monetary policy is seen as the task of the central banks and the profit through money creation should benefit the community.

The NMI not only securitises money, but any kind of rights and obligations.

A user can create accounts for all his rights and obligations and post business transactions. The accounts are part of an abstract and generalized accounting system from which reports can be drawn for any accounting standards. The money infrastructure can also be used to prove rights or obligations that are not currently recorded in balance sheets.

===== Ultimate decentralization

The _New Money Infrastructure_ is decentralized in three ways:

1.  Decentralized governance
2.  Each user stores only his own data and optionally encrypted backups of other users.
3.  Transactions and contracts are only exchanged between the parties directly involved.

As a result, data volume and traffic are kept to a minimum while maintaining maximum efficiency, effectiveness and privacy.

Bitcoin is decentralized in the first sense that there is no _central_ _authority_ that manages the system but there is a common ledger, the blockchain, whose data is stored by all full nodes.footnote:[The clients in the Bitcoin network are called nodes. A full node is a client who stores the complete block chain. More: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Full_node[https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Full_node]]

Early in 2018, the blockchain was about 160 GB in size and there were about 15 million users, but less than 10,000 full nodes that all the other users need to trust in. One of the key objectives of a decentralized system in which no trustees are required is not realized in practice by Bitcoin. - For this, each of the 15 million users would need to store the blockchain, resulting in a data volume of 2,400,000,000 GB, plus an even higher traffic.

In the New Money Infrastructure, the 160 GB would be distributed amongst the 15 million users according to their individual use and without the need of trustees. This result is achieved through a newly developed _legal consensus mechanism_.

===== Legal identiy identifier blockchain tree

===== Legal consensus mechanism

For all crypto currencies, consensus mechanismsfootnote:[A good overview of the consensus mechanisms can be found in _Consensus – Immutable agreement for the Internet of value_: https://assets.kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmg/pdf/2016/06/kpmg-blockchain-consensus-mechanism.pdf] are central to the functioning of any blockchain or distributed ledger. This ensures the correctness of payments and prevents manipulation without the need to trust or rely on a central authority. So far, this problem has been solved purely technically.

Through the newly developed _legal consensus mechanism_ not only money, but all rights and obligations will be turned into digital bearer instruments that have been signed by the senders and can only be read and processed by the legitimate recipients.

The signed data, together with the rights and obligations arising from the contract, will be complementarily distributed amongst the contracting parties, with the result that a party who manipulates his data would destroy his own rights and yet would have to fulfil his obligations under the contract. Rights and data are inextricably linked, as are rights and paper in securities. The rights from the data follow the rights to the data. The power of control over the data is ensured by cryptographic methods and possession.

The correct content of the data is also legally secured through the complementary interests of the parties: The right of the creditor to claim a particular performance refers to the identical performance that the debtor has to provide.

For example, a contract signed by the seller certifies the rights of the buyer and the obligations of the seller. This unique data is stored in the buyer's blockchain. As a result, only he can actually and legally dispose of these data. The buyer cannot manipulate these data because the seller signed them. And without these data, the buyer cannot assert his rights against the seller and the seller is under no obligation to perform.

And vice versa, the contract signed by the buyer certifies the rights of the seller and the obligations of the buyer. This unique data is stored in the seller's blockchain and only he can actually and legally dispose of these data.

The legal consensus mechanism causes users to not manipulate their data; otherwise their own rights would be destroyed. Therefore, the data must be protected only from accidental and third party manipulations, hardware failures and software errors. To prevent such incidents, there are several redundant protection mechanisms installed that can be supplemented by the user himself, if he wishes to do so.

"Proof of Work" is currently the consensus mechanism in the most popular crypto currencies, such as Bitcoin. At the beginning of 2018, Bitcoins’s current estimated annual electricity consumption was 38 TWh with a strong upward trend.footnote:[https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption[Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index]] In comparison, this consumption is higher than that of 7.5 million 4-person households in Germany.

In the money infrastructure, this unimaginable energy consumption is not required and is replaced by a single paragraph within the terms of use, thereby doing more than the "Proof of Work" mechanism: the scaling of the system is independent of the number of users and the transactions can be executed in real time.

===== Recommended, standardized and balanced contracts (RSB contracts)
*Fair trade* *and sustainable business practices* are an extra asset, implemented as an efficient and profitable business model.

Within the _New Money Infrastructure_, business is done with recommended, standardized and balanced contracts (RSB contracts). Contractors should be able to focus on their performance and not have to worry about being tricked by legal intricacies.

RSB contract templates capture and extend the idea of "Smart Contracts". Simply explained an RSB contract is an instrument that allows users to easily and efficiently conduct their business without having to understand the legal details. Users can trust that the different interests are balanced. They are abstract legal structures that, like numbers in mathematics, are described differently in different languages, but have the same meaning in all languages. For RSB contracts there is a localized certified copy in all required languages. The claims and also possible legal consequences in the event of disruptions to performance are clearly indicated in a transparent manner.

What applies to trade in general will apply even more to financial services and financial instruments, which will serve exclusively the people and the real economy.

RSB contracts are well thought out and well coordinated. They implement the idea of international standards in the field of contract law. The motto is as few templates as possible and as much as necessary.

RSB contracts are objects in the sense of object-oriented programming. They have a status, respond to events and can communicate with or act legally for the parties. For example, payments are not made to the payee but to the contracts, which are then forwarded to the payee upon confirmation of reception of the goods by the payee.

RSB contracts generate all the accounting records in various accounting standards that belong to a contract and its related transactions.

RSB contract templates are developed by users, validated by stakeholders and adopted by majority vote.

The RSB contracts go far beyond the points raised, and exploiting their potential will not only be the task of a follow-up project, but will provide business opportunities in many areas.

This includes:

. Automatic accounting not only for companies but for the public sector as well
. Business and economic evaluations to an unprecedented extent and quality
. Risk management and services
. Default management and services
. Collateral management and services
. Rating services

The project is positioned in the spectrum from "idea to application" in such a way that the fundamental functionality and the benefits can be demonstrated on the planned prototype of a test New Money Infrastructure. Users should be able to create accounts and make payments. In addition, additional financial services and instruments will be shown using central examples. If the infrastructure is accepted, it offers an abundance of business opportunities that help to further develop and expand the system.

Not only will users have significant benefits and cost savings, but those who continue to develop and carry the system will benefit from the usage fees. For private users, in general, the system will provide financial services free of charge if they provide the resources they use to the same extent to others.

=== Ambition

==== The novelty

[NOTE]
====
Describe the advance your proposal would provide beyond the state-of-the-art, and the extent the proposed work is ambitious.
====

Within the _New Money Infrastructure_, the money becomes central bank money (positive money, Vollgeld). It is thus in contrast to money in a current account at a commercial bank and in contrast to bitcoins, which are still completely unregulated private money and serve a predominantly speculative purpose.

It would be comparable to cash and thus even safer in the case of financial crises than commercial bank money. Compared to cash, it would be better protected against counterfeiting and theft by using cryptographic methods.

<<img-key_features_of_cash_depositmoney_bitcoin_nmi>> shows the key features of cash, deposit money, Bitcoin, and money in the _New Money Infrastructure._

The implementation of the _New Money Infrastructure_ will be implemented in the ‘style’ of Wikipedia (from bottom to top and supported by many for all).

"As simple as possible, but not simpler" is the guiding principle of the _New Money Infrastructure_ for the design of financial services and financial products and the execution of contracts.

The introduction and operation of the _New Money Infrastructure_ deliberately does not rely on the idealism of supporters and users but on solid economic benefits for those involved.

*Here the relevant excerpt of the work programme:*

*Specific Challenge*:

Recent trends in nationalism, protectionism and regionalism are affecting international commitments and policies. They also put added pressure on the political and operational capacities of global governance institutions created in the mid-twentieth century for critical yet partly different purposes. This raises the prospects of shifts, including in responsibility, in global and transnational governance. The challenge is to identify coherent responses and to effectively coordinate their implementation with stakeholders.

*Scope*:

Proposals should assess contemporary and historical developments in key institutions (e.g. United Nations, North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, World Trade Organisation, Organisation for Security and Cooperation), regimes, processes and partnerships that aim at contributing to collective action and sharing responsibilities in taking on global problem solving. They should also investigate the EU’s role in these processes. In addition, proposals should assess challenges faced by global governance such as representativeness, diverging interests, trust, allocating responsibilities and legitimacy as well as difficulties related to the implementation of agreements. Responses to past challenges should also be assessed. Scenarios of stagnation, transformation or fragmentation should be considered. The impact on the implementation of the EU Global Strategy and on the achievement of the climate goals of the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals of Agenda 2030 should be addressed. The role played by non-state actors, including from the civil and private sectors may also be addressed. Relevant actors (e.g. researchers, policymakers, civil society representatives) should be involved to ensure mutual learning and take-up of results. Due to the specific challenge of this topic, participation of international partners strategically targeted by the EU is encouraged to ensure joint mapping, scenario design and policy recommendations.

The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 2.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

*Expected Impact*:

The action will equip relevant EU actors and partners with knowledge and tools for navigating and influencing effectively the emerging and future shifts in global and transnational governance, thereby increasing their readiness, resilience and capacities for developing globally coordinated strategies.

** any substantial impacts not mentioned in the work programme, that would enhance innovation capacity; create new market opportunities, strengthen competitiveness and growth of companies, address issues related to climate change or the environment, or bring other important benefits for society.

==== Research work package deliverables

Without recourse to existing research and development work, it would be unthinkable to implement the goals in the planned time and available resources. Although some of the experts involved have decades of experience in their fields, it is necessary to round off this knowledge in relation to the task.

===== Evaluation of available wallets

There are many open source wallets and client-user interfaces developed for cryptocurrencies. They will then be examined to what extent they can be used for the New Money Infrastructure or as a template.

===== Evaluation of cryptographic methods

In the area of cryptocurrencies various cryptographic methods are used. This deliverable will analyze the existing methods for use in NMI and decide which method to use.

===== RSB Contracts

RSB contracts are objects in the sense of object-oriented programming. In this deliverable, the requirements for these objects are to be developed. This also includes an axiomatic theory of the law of obligations, in which legal issues are formalized, so that they can be processed by programs.

===== Persistent storage strategy

This deliverable is a survey on how the data should be stored in the overall system. The pros and cons of different strategies should be discussed and projections about the data volume and traffic should be made.  In addition, statements are to be made about the scalability and the reaction times of the system.

On the basis of previous considerations, control, metadata and common data are stored in a server layer and the user data is stored by the user. In addition, at least 3 backups are stored with other users. The volume of data can vary considerably from user to user, since in addition to contracts and payments, other data, such as documents and emails can be stored. For payments, private users are likely to receive less than 1 MB of data per year even with 100-200 payments per month.

The servers of the server layer are distributed to those users who provide the NMI with the required resources and in return receive a pro rata revenue from user fees.

As database management system (DBMS), OrientDBfootnote:[http://orientdb.com/] is in the shortlist.

The functionality of the server layer is realized by stored procedures and plugins.

The required overall functionality will be split into several dedicated servers so that a single DBMS can focus on a particular role.

It should be checked whether, for reasons of simplification, only one server software is developed and then, at runtime, one or more server roles are assigned to a server cluster. This would mean that only one server cluster is running at the beginning, and the bigger the NMI grows the more specialized server clusters will emerge, all running the same software.

==== Server software development work packages

The following types of servers are required:

. *Control servers* that coordinate and control the decentralised system.
. *Resource management servers* that manage and allocate the resources provided by users to the servers.
. *Legal entity servers* that manage the users and store their shared profile data, as well as the status of the user database. These servers also store users' public keys.
. *Taxonomy Servers* store the conceptual hierarchies constructed as binary trees and their translations into the different languages. The path to a term is then used as the system-internal encoding of the term.
. *RSB Template Server* stores and manages the RSB templates. For the user, only the template ID and the variable data are stored in a contract and not the entire contract text.
. *Voting server*: New programs or RSB templates are taken over by the affected users by majority vote.
. *Statistics Servers* store the business and economic evaluations of user data. Users must permit statistical analysis of their data while maintaining data protection.
. *E-mail Server*: Each public key or address is automatically assigned an e-mail account to which payments are forwarded if a user is not online at the time of the transfer. This email address can also be used for a spam-free and encrypted email traffic. The emails can be stored in a blockchain.
. *Software update servers* store the programs and updates of the system and cause updates to the users.
. *Contract and transaction servers* store the blockchain tree with a user's data. Each user has exactly one of these servers

The servers 1. - 9. belong to the server layer. The contract and transaction server stores the database for the client app.

==== Client software development work packages

Possibly also the Client Apps can be realized as Plugins. Thus, the software for the NMI would be implemented uniformly as an extension of the DBMS.

. The *Client App for Businesses and Organizations* is actually a stand-alone multiuser client-server application where the server component can run on its own server. It is also already preconfigured so that the complete accounting could be done.

. The *Private User Client App* is tailored to the needs of private individuals.

. The *Mobile Client App* can be used for private users as well as employees of companies and organizations.

. The *Bank Client App* is the interface to the banking sector. This interface handles payments to and from the money infrastructure and manages the cash reserve of the New Money Infrastructure. Per currency, this app would run either at a central bank or a commercial bank.

.Definition:

_‘*Milestones*’ means control points in the project that help to chart progress. Milestones may correspond to the completion of a key deliverable, allowing the next phase of the work to begin. They may also be needed at intermediary points so that, if problems have arisen, corrective measures can be taken. A milestone may be a critical decision point in the project where, for example, the consortium must decide which of several technologies to adopt for further development._

=== Consortium as a whole

[WARNING]
====
_The individual members of the consortium are described in a separate section 4. There is no need to repeat that information here._
====

[NOTE]
====
* Describe the consortium. How will it match the project’s objectives, and bring together the necessary expertise? How do the members complement one another (and cover the value chain, where appropriate),?

* In what way does each of them contribute to the project? Show that each has a valid role, and adequate resources in the project to fulfil that role.

* If applicable, describe the industrial/commercial involvement in the project to ensure exploitation of the results and explain why this is consistent with and will help to achieve the specific measures which are proposed for exploitation of the results of the project (see section 2.2).
